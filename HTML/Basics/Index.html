            The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of front-end development, 
            and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
        </p>
        <p>

                <h4>Commenting</h4>
                <p>
                    Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes 
                    that are written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of 
                    project you create. With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or 
                    others to jump in and understand where things are at and how they work.

                    plugins, the amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really 
                    productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like

                <h4>Always Be Curious</h4>
                <p>
                    A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news 
                    and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about 
                    front-end development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative 
                    and useful learning sources for front-end developers 
                </p>
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li><a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" target="_blank">Front-End Foc</a></li>
                    <li><a href ="https://css-weekly.com/ ">CSS Weekly</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/"> Javascript Weekly</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/">Web design Weekly</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As a front end developer, you should always be curious about the latest trends, technologies, 
                    and best practices in the web development industry. Curiosity can help you learn new skills, improve your existing ones,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time</h4>
                <p>Refactoring your code from time to time is a good practice that can improve the quality, 
                    readability, and maintainability of your code. Refactoring means modifying the existing 
                    code without changing its functionality, but with the aim of making it more efficient, modular, 
                    or reusable. Refactoring can help you eliminate code smells, reduce technical debt, optimize performance, 
                    enforce coding standards, and prevent bugs. Refactoring should be done incrementally and with the help of 
                    automated tests, to ensure that the code still works as expected.</p>

            </li>
            <li><h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>Version control is a way of managing changes to files and projects over time. It allows you to keep track of
                    different versions of your work, compare and merge them, and restore previous versions if needed. Version 
                    control also enables collaboration, as multiple people can work on the same project and share their changes
                    with each other. Version control systems are software tools that help you perform these tasks, such as Git, Mercurial,
                    or Subversion.</p>
