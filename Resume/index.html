            <p>Hello! I'm Akshay, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at KR Mangalam University. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from ITS Ghaziabad, and I have a robust foundation in computer science and software development.
                
                With intermediate knowledge in <span class="text-highlight">data structures and algorithms, full stack web development, Python programming, and machine learning</span>, I am passionate about technology and innovation. My internship experience at Heinrich as a Software Development Engineer provided me with valuable real-world experience, allowing me to apply my skills to various projects and gain a deeper understanding of industry practices.
                
                I thrive in collaborative environments, where teamwork and adaptability are key. My problem-solving abilities and eagerness to continuously learn and grow drive me to tackle challenges and find innovative solutions. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing table tennis, which help me maintain a balanced and well-rounded perspective.
                
                I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to meaningful projects and look forward to new opportunities that allow me to further develop my expertise and make a positive impact in the tech industry. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!
